        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package Mexican-style chorizo</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package Mexican-style chorizo</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>8 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>½ cup salsa</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package queso fresco, crumbled</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium sweet potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with<br> parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place sweet potatoes and green onions on the baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and <br> sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to combine and spread out evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast in the preheated oven until soft, about 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, cook chorizo in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, breaking apart<br>  with a wooden spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain any excess fat; transfer chorizo to a bowl <br> and set aside to cool. Wipe out the skillet and return it to the stove.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk eggs in a bowl. Heat butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in eggs <br> and scramble until just set, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape eggs into a bowl and let cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line up tortillas in assembly-line fashion. Divide chorizo between the 8 tortillas. Top <br> each with a portion of sweet potato-onion mixture, scrambled eggs, 1 tablespoon <br> salsa, and queso fresco. Fold the bottom of each tortilla up over the filling, then fold <br> in both sides and roll up burritos.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flip burritos so they are seam side-down. Wrap each individually with aluminum foil <br> and place into a resealable plastic bag.
        </li>
    </ol>
