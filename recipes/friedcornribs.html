    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These air fried corn ribs are reminiscent of Mexican street corn, but each ear is split into <br> quarters and then air fried. I used frozen corn on the cob which I thawed.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ears ears corn on the cob</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons "Everything but the Elote <br> seasoning" (Trader Joe's®), divided</li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated cotija cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Mexican crema, crema fresca</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile stand corn cobs on the end, and with a sharp knife (I used a wüsthof <br> nakiri) cut each ear down the middle. Place corn cob halves flat on a cutting board <br> and cut in half lengthwise (you will get a total of 4 'ribs' per ear of corn).</li>
        <li>Spray each corn rib with non-stick spray. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of seasoning over <br> the 16 corn ribs.</li>
        <li>Air fry corn ribs in batches for a total of 12 minutes. Remove from air fryer.</li>
        <li>Drizzle crema con sal over corn 'ribs' and sprinkle with cotija cheese and remaining <br> seasoning. Garnish with chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
